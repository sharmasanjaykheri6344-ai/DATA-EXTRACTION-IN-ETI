        "..>> What is Data Extraction?\n",
        "\n",
        "Data extraction is the first phase of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, in which data is collected from various source systems and moved to a staging area for further processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The source systems can be databases, flat files, APIs, cloud storage, enterprise applications, or streaming platforms. The key goal is to retrieve accurate and complete data without affecting the performance of the source systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role of Data Extraction in the ETL Pipeline\n",
        "1. Starting Point of ETL\n",
        "\n",
        "Extraction initiates the ETL process. Without extracting data correctly, transformation and loading cannot occur.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Extracting sales data from a MySQL database before calculating monthly revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Collection from Multiple Sources\n",

        "3. Ensures Data Availability and Consistency\n",
        "\n",
        "Extraction captures data at a specific point in time, ensuring consistency for reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Daily extraction at midnight to generate accurate daily sales reports.\n",

        "How APIs Help in Real-Time Data Extraction\n",
        "1. Provide Live Access to Data\n",
        "\n",
